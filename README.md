# Estimation of local training data point densities to support the assessment of spatial prediction uncertainty
This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper "Estimation of local training data point densities to support the assessment of spatial prediction uncertainty" by Fabian Schumacher, Christian Knoth, Marvin Ludwig and Hanna Meyer.

Following contents can be found in the repository:

* [simulationStudy.R](code/simulationStudy_withPlotting.R): Contains the code to run the simulation study for the two sampling scenarios simultaneously and generate the respective tables and plots.
* [caseStudy.R](code/caseStudy.R): Contains the code to run the case study and generate the respective plots.
* [data](data/): Contains the predictor data used in the case study, the sampling locations for all studies, the model used in the case study and the modeldomain for the case study.

Please open the project via [LPD.RProj](./LPD.Rproj) to ensure proper relative file paths.
